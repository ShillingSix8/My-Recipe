    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g dried thin spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>400g piece speck, rind removed, cut into 1cm pieces</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Mushroom</li>
        <li>70g (1 cup) fresh breadcrumbs (made from dayâ€‘old bread)</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh continental parsley leaves</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>70g (1 cup) shredded parmesan, plus extra, to serve</li>
        <li>125ml (1/2 cup) double cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water following packet directions. Drain. Return pasta to
        the pan.</p>

    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Meanwhile, heat a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the speck and cook, stirring occasionally, for
        10 minutes or until crisp.</p>

    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Use a slotted spoon to remove speck from the pan and add to the cooked pasta, reserving the fat in the pan. Add
        the breadcrumbs to the pan and cook, tossing, for 3-5 minutes or until they start to turn golden. Add the garlic
        and parsley. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until well combined and aromatic. Transfer to a bowl and set
        aside.</p>

    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Whisk together the eggs and parmesan in a large jug until well combined. Season.</p>

    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>Add cream to pasta mixture. Place over low heat. Toss for 2-3 minutes or until cream is warmed through (be
        careful not to overheat). Remove from heat.</p>

    <h5>Step 6</h5>
    <p>Pour the egg mixture into the pasta mixture and toss until well combined. Return to low heat. Toss constantly for
        1 minute or until the pasta is warmed through. (Do not overcook or the egg will scramble.) Divide among serving
        bowls and sprinkle with the fried garlic bread crumble and extra parmesan to serve.</p>
